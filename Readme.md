## Synopsis

This is a solution for the "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course Project.

### run_analysis.R

This R script generates a tidy dataset out of the original dataset [2] used for the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones study [1] and calculate the average of each variable for each activity and each subject and save it as a CSV File in the working directory. Only the mean and standard deviation variables are used.
If the original Data is not in the working directory, it will be downloaded and unzip automatically [2].

### CodeBook.md

Description of the 
- Study and the original data
- the transformation steps incl. filter and cleaning processes
- variables used in the tidy dataset

## Data Source

Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors

## Course Project Task Definition

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
* Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
